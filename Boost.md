# Boost Library

## Introduction

- Collection of portable C++ source libraries that serve as an extension to the standard C++ library
- Well regarded for its quality, robustness and wide range of functionality
- It is often used to enhance and complement the standard library bringing additional feature and capabilities to C++ development

## Key Features

1. **Extensive Range of Libraries**

- Boost includes libraries for various purposes including string and text processing, memory management, threading, networking, mathematical computations and more

2. **Portability**

- Designed to be highly portable and works on wide range of platforms and compilers
- This make it ideal for cross-platform development

3. **Peer-Reviewed Quality** 

- Libraries in Boost undergo rigorous peer review to ensure high quality, reliability and efficiency

4. **Complement to the STD**

- While Standard C++ library provides a broad range of functionality, Boost fills in many of the gaps
- Offers more specialized or advanced features that are not part of the standard library

5. **Open Source**

- Boost is open-source and free to use, even for commercial applications

## Usage 

- **Header-Only Libraries**
  - Many of the Boost libraries are header-only, meaning they do not require us to compile and link a library binary
  - Just include header files in our project
- **Compatibility with Standard C++**
  - Boost is designed to work well with the existing C++ standard library and its design often influences the evolution of the standard
  - Some of the features originally developed in Boost have been adopted into the C++ Standard Library in C++11 and later versions

## Integration

- Integrating Boost into our C++ projects typically involves adding the Boost headers to our include path and linking against the required Boost Libraries for those that are not header-only

## Popular Boost Libraries

### Boost.Asio

- For network and low-level I/O programming

### Boost.Smart_Ptr

- Smart pointers like **shared_ptr** and **weak_ptr** which complement the standard library's smart pointers

### Boost.Lexical_Cast

- For converting data types
- Similar to casting

### Boost.Thread

- Portable C++ multithreading

### Boost.Algorithm

- Collection of algorithms such as string algorithms

### Boost.Filesystem

- Portable filesystem operations
