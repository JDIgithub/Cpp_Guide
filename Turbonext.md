## FPGA vs GPU


### FPGA

- **F**ield **P**rogrammable **G**ate **A**ray
- Integrated circuit that can be configured by the customer or designer after manufacturing hence field programmable
- They are composed of an array of programmable logic blocks and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects allowing the blocks to be wired together
- Logic blocks can be configured to perform complex combinational functions or merely simple logic gates like AND and XOR
- In the most FPGAs the logic blocks also include memory elements which may be simple flip flops or more complete blocks of memory
- **Application**
  - Digital Signal processing - Due to their ability to handle complex mathematical computations in parallel
  - Prototyping ASICs
  - Cryptography
  - Network Processing - Used in routers, switches, and other network devices to process data at high speeds
  - Medical Imaging - Employed in CT scans and MRIs for processing large amounts of data in real-time
  - Industrial Automation

- **Interfacing FPGA with CPU**
  - **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)**
    - PCIe is a high speed interface standard for connecting components
    - FPGAs can be connected to CPU using PCIe allowing for high speed data transfer
    - The FPGA would include a PCIe endpoint block to interface with the CPU PCIe root complex. This allows the FPGA to appear as PCIe device on the CPUs bus
    - **Driver Development**
      - Write a device driver for the operating system that handles communication data transfers, interrupts, and memory mappings
  
  - **Memory-Mapped I/O**
    - Allows FPGA to be mapped into the CPU address space
    - Configure the FPGA to expose specific registers or memory ares to the CPU. CPU can then read from and write to these areas as if they were normal memory addresses
    - **Driver Development**
      - Develop a driver that maps these memory addresses into the user space, allowing software applications to interact with the FPGA directly
  
  - **AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface)**
    - Part of the ARM Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture specification and is widely used for connecting components in Systems on Chips
    - The FPGA would act as a slave or master device on the AXI bus interfacing with the CPU

  - **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**
    - Simpler method for communication often used for debugging or low speed data transfer
    - The FPGA and CPU would each have UART interface and they would communicate via serial communication


  - **Code Example**




### GPU

- **Architecture**
  - GPUs consist of a large number of smaller, more efficient cores designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously. 
  - While a CPU might have a few powerful cores optimized for sequential processing, a GPU has thousands of smaller cores optimized for parallel tasks.

- **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** 
  - GPUs leverage SIMD architecture, where a single instruction operates on multiple data points concurrently. 
  - This is ideal for tasks like image processing, matrix multiplication, and scientific simulations where the same operation needs to be applied to a large dataset.

- **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)** 
  - Developed by NVIDIA, CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows developers to use NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose processing (an approach known as GPGPU, General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). 
  - It extends the C programming language with keywords and constructs that help in defining parallel tasks and managing GPU memory.

- **OpenCL (Open Computing Language)**
  - OpenCL is an open standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of diverse processors. 
  - It enables the use of GPUs, CPUs, FPGAs, and other processors for a wide range of parallel computing tasks.



## Architecture


### CPU Architecture

- **Basic CPU Components**

  - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** 
    - The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations. 
    - It's a critical part of the CPU where actual computation takes place.
  
  - **Registers**
    - Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU. 
    - They hold data and instructions that the CPU needs immediately.

  - **Control Unit** 
    - The control unit directs the operation of the processor. 
    - It tells the ALU, memory, and I/O devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.
  
  - **Cache** 
    - Cache is a small amount of very fast memory located inside or very close to the CPU. 
    - It stores copies of the data from the most frequently used main memory locations.
    
- **CPU Pipeline**

  - **Fetch** - Retrieve an instruction from memory.
  - **Decode** - Translate the instruction into signals that control other parts of the CPU.
  - **Execute** - Perform the operation specified by the instruction.
  - **Memory Access**  - Read from or write to memory if the instruction requires it.
  - **Write Back** - Store the result of the operation back into a register.

### GPU Architecture

- **Basic GPU Components**

  - **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)** 
    - SMs consist of many smaller, simpler cores designed for parallel processing. 
    - Each SM can execute thousands of threads simultaneously.
  - **Global Memory** 
    - A large memory space accessible by all SMs, used for general data storage.
  - **Shared Memory** 
    - Fast, limited memory that can be shared among the cores within an SM.
  - **Texture and Constant Memory** 
    - Specialized types of memory optimized for specific types of data access patterns.

- **Parallel Processing**

  - **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** 
    - This architecture allows a single instruction to be executed on multiple data points simultaneously. 
    - It's the basis for many parallel processing tasks.
  - **SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads)**
    -  NVIDIA's architecture where a group of threads (a warp) executes the same instruction simultaneously.
  

### Memory Hierarchies

- **Cache Levels**

  - **L1 Cache**
    - The smallest and fastest cache, located closest to the CPU cores. 
    - It is often divided into an instruction cache (L1i) and a data cache (L1d).
  
  - **L2 Cache** 
    - Larger and slower than L1, but still faster than main memory. It is often shared among multiple cores.
  
  - **L3 Cache** 
    - Even larger and slower, shared across all cores in a CPU.

- **Main Memory (RAM)**

  - Main memory is volatile memory where the CPU stores data that is actively used or processed. 
  - DRAM (Dynamic RAM) is the most common type of main memory.
  
- **Storage:**

   - Non-volatile memory such as SSDs (Solid State Drives) or HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) is used for long-term data storage.


- Caches (L1, L2, L3) provide increasingly larger but slower storage close to the CPU cores. 
- Main memory (RAM) is larger and slower than cache, used for actively processed data. 
- Storage (SSDs/HDDs) is used for long-term data storage.


- **Bus Systems (PCIe)**

- **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)**

  - PCIe is a high-speed interface standard used to connect various hardware components like GPUs, SSDs, and network cards to the motherboard.
  - **Lanes** 
    - PCIe connections consist of lanes, each containing two pairs of wires (one for sending and one for receiving data). 
    - Common configurations are x1, x4, x8, and x16, indicating the number of lanes.
  - **Versions** 
    - PCIe versions (e.g., PCIe 3.0, 4.0, 5.0) denote the speed and bandwidth improvements. 
    - For instance, PCIe 4.0 doubles the bandwidth per lane compared to PCIe 3.0.
